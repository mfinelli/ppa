ansible (2.7.5+dfsg-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  With this version build and runtime of ansible has switched to python3. If you
  don't use custom task modules or custom inventory modules, this will likely
  not affect you. If you do have the above, you need to ensure those work with
  python 3 before upgrading. Instructions and migration tips can be found in the
  upstream documentation or in the ansible-doc package.

  Note that switching will only affects the ansible controller. The remote nodes
  will continue to use python 2. This means you need to ensure that your custom
  task modules run on both python 2 and 3.

  If you also want to switch the remote nodes to python 3, you need to ensure
  that they have at least python 3.5 installed. You can then set the
  "ansible_python_interpreter" inventory variable to /usr/bin/python3.
